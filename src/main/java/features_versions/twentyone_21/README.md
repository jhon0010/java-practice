# Java JDK 21: Overview of New Features
Java JDK 21, the latest release as of March 21, 2023, continues Java's tradition of evolving with new features and functionalities to enhance development experience. Notably, JDK 21 is not an LTS (Long-Term Support) release and paves the way for JDK 22.

New Features in JDK 21
1. Language Feature Enhancements
   Record Patterns & Pattern Matching for Switch Expressions: Enhancements to pattern matching allow for more intuitive deconstruction of complex data types and direct pattern matching in switch cases, simplifying code readability and reducing the need for condition checking.

String Templates: Introduces a new way of handling strings, allowing expressions and code to be mixed seamlessly. This feature simplifies string manipulation, making code cleaner and more intuitive.

Unnamed Patterns and Variables: Supports using an underscore (_) to ignore unneeded variables or types in coding, enhancing code clarity by focusing on relevant data.
2. Libraries Improvements
   Virtual Threads: Introduces lightweight threads that execute tasks efficiently without significant memory overhead, facilitating easier concurrency management.

Sequenced Collections: New interfaces and methods for collections that maintain a specific order, improving operations like accessing the first and last elements or iterating in reverse order.

Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs): Introduces an API for securely storing secret keys, enhancing Java's cryptographic capabilities.

Vector API Enhancements: Continues to improve the Vector API for optimal performance in tasks requiring vector computations, such as graphics rendering or scientific calculations.

3. Performance Improvements
   Z Garbage Collection (ZGC) Enhancements: Improves memory management by performing concurrent garbage collection, reducing application pause times and optimizing memory usage.
4. Tools Improvements
   Enhancements to Runtime.exec and ProcessBuilder for starting new processes, including better tracking and logging capabilities for debugging and monitoring application behavior.
5. Java Emoji Support Tools
   Introduces methods in java.lang.Character for handling emoji properties according to the Unicode Standard, simplifying operations like checking if a character is an emoji.
6. HttpClient Lifecycle Management
   Adds new methods to HttpClient for managing its lifecycle more efficiently, including methods for closing, shutting down, and checking termination status, facilitating better resource management in applications.
7. StringBuilder and StringBuffer Repeated Appending
   New methods in StringBuilder and StringBuffer for appending repeated characters or sequences more efficiently, eliminating the need for manual loops and improving code readability.
8. Advancements in Java Collections with Sequenced Interface
   Enhances the collections framework by introducing new interfaces for collections that ensure a clear sequence order, offering more intuitive and powerful methods for managing collections.
