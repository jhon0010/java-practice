# Java 16 Features Summary

1. Pattern Matching for instanceof (JEP 394) [Standard Feature]
   Simplifies conditional extraction of components from objects, combining instanceof checks and variable assignment into a single operation.
2. Records (JEP 395) [Standard Feature]
   Introduces a compact syntax for declaring data-holding classes, automatically generating equals(), hashCode(), toString(), and accessors.
3. Sealed Classes (JEP 397) [Second Preview]
   Restricts which classes or interfaces can extend or implement them, providing more control over inheritance and ensuring a class is extended only by explicitly permitted types.
4. Foreign Function & Memory API (JEP 338) [Incubator]
   Enhances interoperability with native code and memory outside of the Java heap, aiming to replace sun.misc.Unsafe with a safer, more efficient API.
5. Vector API (JEP 338) [Incubator]
   Provides a mechanism to express vector computations that compile at runtime to optimal vector instructions, improving performance for computations that can be vectorized.
6. Enable C++14 Language Features (JEP 347)
   Updates JDK source code to use C++14 language features, aiming to modernize the JDK codebase and leverage new C++ language features.
7. Unix-Domain Socket Channels (JEP 380)
   Adds support for Unix-domain (AF_UNIX) socket channels and selectors, offering a more efficient alternative for inter-process communication on the same host.
8. Incubator Modules and Other Enhancements
   Includes various incubator modules and enhancements to improve the Java platform's performance, security, and functionality.
