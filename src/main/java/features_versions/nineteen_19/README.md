# Java 19

## Preview Features:

Record Patterns (JEP 405): Enables deconstructing record values using patterns for clearer and more concise code.
Virtual Threads (JEP 425): Provides a lightweight threading implementation for high-throughput concurrent applications.
Foreign Function & Memory API (JEP 424): Allows Java programs to interoperate with code and data outside the Java runtime, improving performance and flexibility.
Pattern Matching for switch (JEP 427): Extends the switch statement with pattern matching capabilities for more readable and powerful conditional statements (third preview).

## Incubator Features:

Vector API (JEP 426): Offers an API for vector computation utilizing modern SIMD instructions for improved performance in numerical applications (fourth incubator).
Structured Concurrency (JEP 428): Introduces an experimental API for managing asynchronous tasks with less boilerplate code (incubator).
Other Notable Changes:

Deprecation of Locale class constructors: Encourages the use of static factory methods for creating Locale objects.
Automatic Generation of the CDS Archive: Improves class loading performance by automatically generating the CDS archive during installation.
Linux/RISC-V Port (JEP 422): Provides an official Java port for the RISC-V architecture.
